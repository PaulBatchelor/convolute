convolute-specific code is released under the ISC license, as included
in COPYING.ISC.

convolute also includes code from kiss_fft, released under a BSD-like
license, included in kissfft/COPYING.

However, if you choose to enable linking with fftw3 by compiling with
USE_FFTW3=1, the convolute code is then subject to the GPL version 2
(or, at your option, any later version,) included in COPYING.GPL.
